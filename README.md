## guide

### balancing.csv

Master balancing sheet. Should always be up to date with the latest changes.

### testing.csv

Testing sheet. Gets imported into dev branch when updated.

### /changes

Folder containing all change sheets. These are used to balance groups of attachments to then be ported into `balancing.csv`.

### /changelogs

Folder containing all generated changelog markdown files.

### /archive

Folder containing all balancing sheets from previous versions. These are used to generate changelogs.

### port.py

Script to port changes from a change sheet into `balancing.csv` or `testing.csv`. Usage:

```bash
python port.py (change sheet) (target sheet) [header row]  
python port.py "changes/changes.csv" "testing.csv" 2
```

- Updates the date in the target sheet automatically.
- Matches rows by `name` column, make sure those are included in the change sheet.
- Order of columns in the change sheet does not matter.
- Empty cells will overwrite existing data. Be careful.
- `[header row]` is the row # of the column headers in the change sheet. Useful for extra labels or dates above the headers. Optional, defaults to 1.

### diff.py

Script to compare two sheets and output a changelog. Usage:

```bash
python diff.py (old sheet) (new sheet)
python diff.py "archive/0-22-12.csv" "balancing.csv"
```

- Outputs a changelog to `changelogs/version-changelog.md`.
- Matches rows by `name` column.
- Uses the `pretty_name` column for display in the changelog, falling back to `name`.
